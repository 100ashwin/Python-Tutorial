# The following are the variable rules that you should keep in mind:

# Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
# They can start with a letter or an underscore (_), not with a number.
# Variable names cannot contain spaces. To separate words in variables, you use
# underscores, for example sorted_list.
# Variable names cannot be the same as keywords, reserved words, and built-in
# functions in Python.


# Summary:

# A variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. The value of a
# variable can change throughout the program.
# Use the variable_name = value to create a variable.
# The variable names should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Also,
# they should adhere to Python variable naming rules.
